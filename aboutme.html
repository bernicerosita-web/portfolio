        <p> Hi! I'm an aspiring <span class="highlight">Game Developer</span> with a deep passion for creating immersive and interactive experiences.
            Ever since I discovered how games are built, I’ve been fascinated by the creativity and logic behind them.
            I enjoy learning programming, designing game mechanics, and understanding how virtual worlds come to life.
            My goal is to become a professional game developer who builds engaging, meaningful, and innovative games that inspire players around the world.
            Every day, I work on improving my coding skills and expanding my knowledge to turn my passion into a successful career.

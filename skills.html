    <h1>My Skills</h1>

    <p>
        I have a strong foundation in front-end web development, with hands-on experience in 
        <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>. 
        I am confident in building structured, responsive, and visually appealing web pages 
        using clean and well-organized code. I focus on writing semantic HTML and designing 
        modern user interfaces with CSS styling techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, I am expanding my programming knowledge by learning 
        <span class="highlight">C#</span>. I am developing a solid understanding of 
        object-oriented programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and logical thinking. 
        My goal is to use C# in game development and continue strengthening my technical skills 
        to build interactive and engaging applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am continuously learning, practicing, and improving my skills to grow as a 
        developer and move closer to my goal of becoming a professional game developer.
